1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
   local?
	
	A: It creates redundancy as well as allows others to contribute to your project

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
   automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   A: Perhaps you are working on a feature that is not ready for public consumption.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
   use one instead of another?

	  Clone will make a replica of a branch into a repository
	  Branch is an off shoot of an existing repository

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
   stored locally?
